This is primarily to help us better understand how our fans use our digital platforms to enable us create better content and more relevant communications:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>how you have reached our digital platform and the internet protocol (IP) address you have used</li>\n          <li>your browser type, versions and plug-ins, and your operating system</li>\n          <li>your journey through our digital platform, including which links you click on and any searches you made, how long you stayed on a page, and other page interaction information</li>\n          <li>which videos you have watched and for how long</li>\n          <li>what content you like or share</li>\n          <li>which adverts you saw and responded to</li>\n          <li>which pop up or push messages you might have seen and responded to</li>\n          <li>your subscription status</li>\n          <li>information collected in any forms you complete</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>We may also infer your country of location from the IP address you have used to access our digital platforms.</p>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">USING YOUR INFORMATION FOR RELEVANT MARKETING</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>If you have purchased a service, like a cricket membership or ticket, then we may use your contact details to inform you about other future events or special offers, which are relevant to that service</li>\n          <li>This applies whether you purchased goods or services online, over the phone or in-person at the venue</li>\n          <li>As a recent customer of a service, we have judged that such relevant communications will be in your best interests (i.e. the lawful basis for this purpose, under the Data Protection Laws, is ‘legitimate interest’)</li>\n          <li>Your personal information will be profiled in order to personalise our marketing communications so that they match your interest(s)</li>\n          <li>If you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, then you will always be given the opportunity to opt-out or unsubscribe from future communications from us</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">COOKIES</p>\n        <p>In common with many other website operators, we may use standard technology called 'cookies' on this website. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive and they are used to record how you navigate Middlesex Cricket's website on each visit.</p>\n        <p>Our cookies are used to enable us to develop Middlesex Cricket's website and to enable you to properly navigate it. We use cookies to collect personal information to enable us to reflect our users interests and by noting who has seen which pages, properties and advertisements (including ‘click throughs’ from emails), how frequently particular pages are visited and to enable us to determine the most popular areas of Middlesex Cricket's website. We may use cookies to enrich your experience of using Middlesex Cricket's website by allowing us to tailor what you see to what we have learned about your preferences during your visits to our sites. Sometimes we may use services of third parties and they may use cookies on our behalf in order to provide their services.</p>\n        <p>The cookies we use on our website (middlesexccc.com) are shown below: </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Google analytics</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">PREVENTING USE OF COOKIES</p>\n        <p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent cookies being stored. With experience, you can usually choose to switch off all cookies or to allow only certain ‘trusted’ sites to place cookies.</p>\n        <p>For further information on cookies and Flash cookies and how to switch them off see the Information <a href=\"http://www.ico.gov.uk\" class=\"text-warning\">www.ico.gov.uk</a> or visit <a href=\"http://www.allaboutcookies.org/\" class=\"text-warning\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.allaboutcookies.org\" class=\"text-warning\">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> or <a href=\"http://www.aboutcookies.org/\" class=\"text-warning\">www.aboutcookies.org.</a></p>\n        <p>Please note: If you do turn Cookies off, this will limit the experience we are able to provide to you and may affect your user experience.</p>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">TRACKING TECHNOLOGY</p>\n        <p>Occasionally, we may use digital tracking (usually in a cookie) on Middlesex Cricket's website or in emails we send to you. We use these to ensure you receive appropriate information and do not receive multiple communications about the same thing (such as ticketing offers) from different cricket related organisations.</p>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">PREVENTING USE OF TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</p>\n        <p>If you stop cookies, this will normally stop any tracking from the website. Where we plan to use tracking technology, we will ask for your consent.</p>\n        <p>Please note: If you do not allow us to use tracking technology, you may receive communications that are of less interest to you or from all of those involved in putting on an event</p>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</p>\n        <p>In order to provide our products and services to you or to otherwise fulfil contractual arrangements that we have with you, we may need to appoint other organisations to carry out some of the data processing activities on our behalf. These may include, for example, payment processing organisations, delivery organisations, fraud prevention and screening and credit risk management companies, and mailing houses.</p>\n        <p>We may share your data with advertising networks for the purposes of selecting and serving relevant adverts to you via those networks/platforms, and to search engine and analytics providers.</p>\n        <p>We may share your data with third parties (a) if we are under a legal or regulatory duty to do so, (b) if it is necessary to do so to enforce our terms of use or other contractual rights, (c) to lawfully assist the police or security services with the prevention and detection of crime or terrorist activity, (d) where such disclosure is necessary to protect the safety or security of any persons, and/or (e) otherwise as permitted under applicable law.</p>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">SECURITY OF INFORMATION</p>\n        <p>We take the security of your personal information seriously. We have security procedures in place to protect our paper based systems and computerised databases from loss and misuse, and only allow access to them when it is absolutely necessary to do so, and then under strict guidelines as to what use may be made of the personal information contained within them.</p>\n        <p>Where a password is required to access certain areas of our digital platforms, you are responsible for keeping your password secure and confidential. Please do not share or disclose your password to any other person.</p>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">MONITORING</p>\n        <p>Please note that for your safety and security, CCTV may be in operation at our premises which are open to the public.</p>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">IF YOU ARE AGED UNDER 16</p>\n        <p>If you are under 16 and register for restricted areas of our digital platforms, we will collect your date of birth and retain that with your name and other details you may provide. This is so we can ensure we treat you in an age appropriate way in line with this policy.</p>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</p>\n        <p>We aim to meet high standards and our policies and procedures are, therefore, constantly under review. From time to time we may change our security and privacy policies to ensure they meet current legislation. Accordingly we recommend that you check this page periodically in order to review our current policies. </p>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">UPDATING AND CORRECTING YOUR INFORMATION</p>\n        <p>You may correct or amend your personal information by calling us on 020 7289 1300 or by emailing us at <u><a href=\"mailto:dataprotection@middlesexccc.com\" class=\"text-warning\">dataprotection@middlesexccc.com</a></u>.
