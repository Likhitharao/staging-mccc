It is the responsibility of the joining member to ensure they check the distance from their registered address to Lord's before joining the club as a Country Member. All Country memberships are checked for accuracy upon new applications being received by the club, and should any new member join as a Country member who resides within the 50-mile threshold, they will be contacted by the club and advised that their membership category will need to change to that of a Full Member.</p>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">STUDENT MEMBERSHIP QUALIFICIATION</p>\n        <p>Student membership is available to anyone aged 23 and above.

The club will then hold this on file and ensure that the next time we send a membership card to renewing members that the new card will carry this photograph. Any members without photos on membership cards who attempt to gain entry into the Lord’s Pavilion will be denied access and advised to head to the Middlesex Reception, where a photo can be taken and placed on file.</p>\n        <hr>\n        <h6 class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 py-3\">MONTHLY DIRECT DEBIT CONDITIONS</h6>\n        <p class=\"memberTitle card-title h-25 pb-3\">MONTHLY DIRECT DEBIT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - YOUR MEMBERSHIP</p>\n        <p>You agree to take out the selected Middlesex Cricket membership for one year, with a minimum of twelve equal monthly instalments.</p>\n        <p>We will write to you shortly before the end of your membership year and supply you with renewal instructions for the following year.
